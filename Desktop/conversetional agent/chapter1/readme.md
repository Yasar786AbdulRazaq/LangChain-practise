Perfect, Yasar! We'll build your GitHub project step by step, chapter-wise. Since this is **Chapter 1**, I’ll write a specific `README.md` section for this file and set the structure accordingly.

### ✅ Step 1: Folder & File Structure

Let’s name your project folder something like:

```
gemini-langchain-tutorial/
└── chapter-1/
    └── main.py
```

---

### 📄 Chapter 1 – `README.md` Content

Here’s the `README.md` section specifically for **Chapter 1**:

```markdown
# Chapter 1: Getting Started with Gemini AI and LangChain

In this chapter, you'll learn how to connect to Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model using LangChain and securely manage your API key with `python-decouple`.

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

- How to use LangChain with Gemini
- Managing secrets with `.env` using `python-decouple`
- Sending a simple prompt and getting a response

## 📁 File Structure

```
chapter-1/
├── main.py
└── .env
```

## 🔐 Setup Instructions

1. **Create a `.env` file** in the `chapter-1/` directory:

```
GENAI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

2. **Install the dependencies**:

```bash
pip install python-decouple langchain-google-genai
```

3. **Run the script**:

```bash
python main.py
```

You’ll see the response printed from the Gemini model.

## 📝 main.py Explained

```python
from decouple import config
from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI

SECRET_KEY = config('GENAI_API_KEY')
llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-1.5-flash", api_key=SECRET_KEY)

res = llm.invoke("what are you doing.")
print(res.content)
```

This simple script:
- Loads the Gemini API key from `.env`
- Initializes the LangChain wrapper
- Sends a prompt and prints the AI's response

⬇️ Let me know when you’re ready for Chapter 2 and upload the next file. I’ll guide you with the next step and `README.md` for that as well.
